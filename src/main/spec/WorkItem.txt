# Rule
#
# A WorkItem can only be added to a SwimLane
#
# If the total number of WorkItem in a SwimLane exceeds the WIP limit,
# no more WorkItem can be added or moved to the SwimLane
#
# The cycle time/lead time of an WorkItem should be able to calculate
# (In order to calculate cycle time/lead time,
# When a WorkItem is added or moved to a SwimLane, an standard.domain event is generated)
#
# A WorkItem has five built-in types: Standard (Regular), Fix Delivery Date, Expedite,
# Intangible (Technical), and Bug. The default type is Standard
#
# A WorkItem could be blocked by a BlockItem, and at that time, the blocked WorkItem
# cannot be moved or deleted unless the BlockItem is removed

# Feature: Add a work item

# Add a work item to the ScrumBoard
Given an board named "ScrumBoard" with "To Do", "Doing", and "Done" stages
When I add a work item named "Implement Apple pay" to the "To Do" stage
Then the work item should be added to the default swim lane of the "To Do" stage
And a WorkItemAdded event should be fired


#################
# Feature: Move a work item

# Move a work item to the "Doing" stage of the ScrumBoard
Given an board named "ScrumBoard" with "To Do", "Doing", and "Done" stages
And a work item named "Implement Apply pay" is in the "To Do" stage
When I move the work item to the "Doing" stage
Then the work item should be moved from the "To Do" stage to the default swim lane of the "Doing" stage
And a WorkItemMoved event should be fired
